Since the beginning of the video game industry, video game monetization models have changed a lot. However, the premium game model (with sub-models such as arcade games, full-price games, game expansions, etc.) has been the main monetization model in the industry for a long time. 

On the other hand, the free-to-play model (with sub-models such as web games with ads) has been around for a long time but has reduced revenues compared to the premium model.

But this has changed in the last 10 years, free-to-play has far surpassed the revenue generated by premium games, to the point that several IPs have changed their monetization models from premium to free-to-play, even in games that are in real operations (Fornite being the most famous case).
This change of models was accompanied by a change in the way of designing a video game, and in this article, we will explore this new design philosophy, the following notes are a study I have done based on my experience as a player and developer of indie games.

## **Basic game components**
A videogame is composed of the following elements:

- **Player:**
The entity that interacts with the game.
- **Goal:**
The objective that is required to get or reach to complete the game
- **Opposition (Obstacle or challenge):**
The entities that will stop or delay the player from completing the game
- **Decisions:**
The interactive options available to perform by the player
- **Rules:**
The actions that the player can or cannot do to reach the goal, these rules control all other elements.

All these elements are inside a gameplay loop. No matter the monetization models, all games should have well-defined elements to build the next part of the game design document.
As a practical example, let's analyze one of the more popular and profitable games at their time: **Pac-Man**.

![image tooltip here](/assets/images/GameDesignBlog/pac-man.png)
- Player = Pac-Man
- Goal = Eat food (small dots, big dots, fruit, ghost on edible state)
- Opposition = Walls and Ghosts(Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde)
- Decisions = Look Up, Down, Left or Right, eat small dot, eat big dot, eat ghost on the edible state.
- Rules = Pac-Man always moves in the facing direction. If Pac-Man hits a wall, Pac-Man stops moving. If the ghost in a normal state hits Pac-Man, game over. If Pac-Man eats a small dot, increase the score. If Pac-Man eats big dots, increase the score and set all Ghosts on an edible state for 5 seconds, etc.(there are much more rules, it is important to define all rules to be fair with the player, but also to add/edit/remove rules for making the game more entertaining)


## **Gameplay loops**
A game loop is a series of activities or actions that a player performs repetitively during a game session.
Here we start to see some differences between Premium and Free-to-Play games, while Premium games do not need to worry about the length of a game session, for example: completing an average multiplayer game of Civilization 6 can last from 2 to 8 hours or more, in other hands, complete an average multiplayer game of Overwatch will last about 10 to 15 minutes. In either case, the player will not experience all the content available in the game in both cases.
In contrast, Free-to-play games need a reduced game loop, this length can vary depending on the genre, but a general rule is that the shorter the main game loop, the better, this is required due to the Free-To-Play games are mainly focused on casual players that play in mobile devices, but this can also apply to PC/Console game, the key point here is to do not exhaust player by letting them consume all the game content in on a game session, and, at the same time, catching the player with a simple but catching game loop.
Of course, there are exceptions to this game loop length rule, but these are mostly for niche games and will require a lot of analysis to convert a niche genre premium game into a free to play. If you are looking for an example of this exception, check out the game Path of Exile (Free-To-Play with a large main game loop)

## **Game Loop Types**
A videogame can be divided into these 3 game loop types

- **Intro gameplay loop**: 
also known as the tutorial, in this game loop, the player is introduced to how works the main game features, for Free-To-Play games, is important to teach how to play at the same time that the player is trying the game features because most of Free-To-Play try a lot of game with the same monetization model, and if you cannot catch them in the first 5 minutes after the game is installed, you may lose it, but do not limit to jump direct to gameplay, if you have the resources to display a good intro to the game story, you can use this game loop to showcase that.

- **Core gameplay loop**:
This is the main game loop and is the most important type of loop because it will be the most played during the whole duration of the game, this game loop includes all the features shown during the game introduction loop and more when prototyping a Free-To-Play game, this is the first loop you should work on. If this loop is not entertaining enough, you should keep iterating until you have at least a non-boring gameplay loop, you can always make the game more engaging with other non-gameplay elements. (such as story, characters, music, etc.) 
Although monetization is a key part of any Free-To-Play, you should not include monetization features in the game loop, because not all players will use the in-game store, focus on having fun gameplay first, and then look at how you can make your monetization model more engaging, beyond controversies, loot boxes and Gacha mechanics are just one of the many ways you can make in-game asset purchases more engaging.

- **Ending gameplay loop**: 
Also known as the end game, this will be the final gameplay loop that the player will experience even if your Free-To-Play game is a service or not, this loop is available by the end of the game, and is the way you can give the player a more challenging game loop to put on test their skills and purchased items, this game loop is not as important as the other ones however it is the best way to reward the most loyal players for their dedication to the game by giving them an exclusive game experience.

Now that we know what are the game loop types, we need to review the systems that help the player to move from one game loop into the next one. In the second part of these articles about game design for free-to-play games, we will talk about progression systems and different free-to-play monetization models.
